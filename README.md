![Walmart_Logo](Description_img.jpg)

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Objectives
This project focuses on End-to-End Data Analysis using Python and SQL to extract meaningful insights from Walmart's sales dataset. The key objectives of this project are:

1.) Data Extraction:

The dataset, which contains Walmart sales records, is sourced from Kaggle.
It is extracted and prepared for analysis.

2.) Data Processing & Cleaning:

Using Python (Pandas), the dataset is preprocessed.
Missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues are resolved to ensure data quality.

3.) Loading Data into MySQL:

The cleaned dataset is stored in a Relational Database (MySQL) for structured querying.
SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL are used to establish a connection between Python and MySQL, enabling seamless data transfer.

4.) Advanced Querying & Business Insights:

SQL queries are used to perform in-depth sales analysis.
Business problems like revenue trends, sales performance, and customer behavior patterns are explored.

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
